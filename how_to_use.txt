fill the my_grades.txt file with your grades in the following format:
CourseName,CreditHours,YourGrade #without any spaces and avoid abbreviations such as IOT. Instead write InternetOfThings

Ex: 
English2,2,D

after you finish listing the courses of a specific semester, write a single underscore '_' as a separator, this helps in providing a detailed report
if you don't want a report just list all the courses without any separators

Ex:
Course1,CH1,G1
Course2,CH2,G2
...
Course6,CH6,G6
_
Course7,CH7,G7
....
CourseN,CHN,GN
